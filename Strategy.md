# Strategy
This file will describe a strategy to build this project in phases.  Each phase will be described in only a high-level of detail here. 
Details should include addtions and changes to architecture for the applications being built
Details should also include the overall system architecture, data model changes, technologies and tooling, and goals.

## Phase 1:  Get a web app running that simulates an EMR that loads/communicates data in FHIR formats.

Looking at PyHipster and JHipster to easily spin up a web app framework ->  web server backend, data model, services and front-end with main (a template) site
JHipster will be used to setup Sprint backend, React or Angular front end.  PyHistper would give us Flask or Django I believe, with React front end.
