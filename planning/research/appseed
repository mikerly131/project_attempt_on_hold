Found a site appseed that has some configured templates for deploying a flask or django web app.
Some of them have React/JS front ends, others seem mainly just HTML/CSS and maybe a little JS.

So far I can't get either of the 2 generators/templates that have React/npm/Node components to actually install.
Throws all sorts of errors and its taking longer than 30 minutes to debug anything, if it works at all.

Going to go with a front-end that isn't react or angular if I can.  (Pixel or MakeKit seem decent, open source)
My goal here isn't to become proficient with a garbage script lang like JS or its frameworks.
